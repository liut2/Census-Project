# Census-Project
## Brief Introduction
This is a course project which focuses on parallel computing concepts. In this project, my partner and I implement the census program based on a few different approaches like:
* sequential computing
* fork-join algorithm without lock
* lock-based fork-join framework with a fixed sized thread pool

In the end, we are asked to compare the performance of different approaches.
